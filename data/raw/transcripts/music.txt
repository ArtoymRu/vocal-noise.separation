Comin' over in my direction So thankful for that it's such a blessin' yeah Turn every situation into heaven yeah Oh-oh you are My sunrise on the darkest day Got me feelin' some kind of way Make me wanna savor every moment slowly slowly You fit me tailor-made love how you put it on Got the only key know how to turn it on The way you nibble on my ear the only words I wanna hear Baby take it slow so we can last long
